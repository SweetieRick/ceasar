# Ceasar
A minimalist c++ utility to encrypt strings in Cesareus Code by using shifting

You can find the main file script in the program in **cesares.cpp**
I also compiled from source using MacOS **clang** utility included in Xcode 12.2 (Big Sur Beta)

*I suggest you to compile from source instead of mounting Mono or some other framework onto the executable*
To compile, you will need **Vs Code** and the **C** extension installed

```
$ mkdir cesares/
$ cd cesares
$ code .
```

Then in VS code go on *Terminal* > *Run from build* and then compile using a C compiler compatible with your system
